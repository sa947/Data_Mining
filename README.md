R Programming Exercise and solutions

CODE 1

Use the following  car evaluation dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation) to find

1. Which two cars are most similar? 

2. Which two cars are most dissimilar?

3. Find the two categorical attributes that have the highest positive/negative correlation. Draw a scatter plot of these two attributes. 

4. Present the dissimilarity matrix for the very good cars. 

CODE 2

Implementing Association rule mining algorithms and related concepts:

The following dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Plants

contains the plants and different states where they are observed.

Using this dataset, answer the following question:

1. In the state of CA, which plant has the highest observation?

2. For the species acalypha, find the max patterns of states where they are observed with min-support =10%

3. For the state of CA, find all the association rules with min-conf 20%

CODE 3

Using the following dataset : 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

1) Clean up the data. Describe the method you use. Drop all the attributes that have more than 50% missing values. (1)

2) What are the Homogeneity score and Silhouette score of the K-means clustering over the data if we assume that the number of different values of attribute "race" is the number of clusters. Consider missing values as its own category. Is Race a good attribute to cluster this data? (1.5)

3) which of the three attributes "gender","age", or "readmitted" is better to cluster the data according to it? (2) Describe what you did and show the results. 

4) Which clustering method is better assuming we are interested in clustering the data, base on the readmitted attribute. K-means or K-medians? Give a reason why the method you choose is better? (1)

5) Going back to question 2, Run Hierarchical clustering method using Cosine Distance and compare the results to K-means. Calculate the two metrics in question 2. Which one is better ? Why? (2.5)
